# ardour-templates
A couple of Ardour templates for podcasting

## Aim

Ardour is a great tool for audio production especially on Linux. While its
primary focus is on music production it can also be used for podcasting. In
this repo we will collect Ardour templates, to use ardour as a fully fledged
podcast studio.

We will collect session templates as well as route templates.

## Installation

Just run
```
$ ./install.sh
```
It is assumed that you've been running Ardour5 before on the machine.

## Usage

You can create Ardour sessions and tracks using the templates. The workflows
are discussed in german language in the Youtube playlist:

### Sessions

When creating a new session you are asked whether a template should be
used. Then just pick the one you want.

### Tracks

When creating a track you can select a template for it.

## The templates

So far there are the following templates

### N-1 set up using Studio Link

It features a remote discussion setup in which the remote participant receives
a mix of everything (N) except his/her own voice (-1). Hence the name N-1.

You need to install the Studio Link plugin (http://studio-link.de)
